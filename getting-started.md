# Getting Started with Haiku



#### CREATING YOUR ACCOUNT

You can sign up for an account at [https://www.haiku.ai/](https://www.haiku.ai/).

<br>

#### DOWNLOADING HAIKU

When you create your account, you will automatically be taken to the download site for Haiku.

Please install Haiku by dragging it to your `/Applications` folder.

<br>

#### DOWNLOADING SKETCH

To get the most out of Haiku, you will need Sketch installed. (Haiku doesn't _yet_ have any of its own drawing tools, and we support rich integration with Sketch for this purpose.)

If you don't have Sketch, you can download a free 30-day trial at [https://sketchapp.com/](https://sketchapp.com/).

> _Coming soon:_ We plan to support other drawing tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, plus eventually we'll have some of our own.

<br>

#### INSTALLING THE HAIKU CLI

The CLI \(Command Line Interface\) is an optional part of Haiku, but it opens up a lot of powerful features â€” for example, you need the CLI to import a Haiku into an existing codebase, or you can use the CLI to directly clone a Haiku project to your computer, to access and edit the code manually.

To install, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

`npm install -g @haiku/cli `
OR
`yarn global add @haiku/cli`
