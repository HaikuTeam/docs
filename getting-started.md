# Getting Started with Haiku
<br>

#### HAIKU OVERVIEW

Haiku is a design tool for teams where you can bring your designs to life with animation and interactivity. You can then easily publish them as web-ready components. If you want to learn more about all Haiku can do go [here](/what-is-haiku.md) and if you want to get started with Haiku - read on!

<br>

#### DOWNLOADING HAIKU

To download Haiku, you'll first need to create an account at [https://www.haiku.ai/](https://www.haiku.ai/).

Once you create your account, you will automatically be taken to the download site for Haiku.

Please install Haiku by dragging it to your `/Applications` folder.

<br>

#### OTHER TOOLS

Haiku  integrates with Sketch, Illustrator, and Figma. To get the most out of Haiku, you'll want to use one of these tools so you can import your designs easily into Haiku.

If you don't have Sketch, you can download a free 30-day trial at [https://sketchapp.com/](https://sketchapp.com/).

If you don't use Figma, you can access it for free for individuals at [https://figma.com](https://figma.com).

If you don't have illustrator, you can learn more here [https://adobe.com/illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html)

> _Coming soon:_ We plan to support other drawing tools like Adobe Photoshop and eventually we'll have some of our own.

#### INSTALLING THE HAIKU CLI

The CLI \(Command Line Interface\) is an optional part of Haiku, but it opens up a lot of powerful features â€” for example, you need the CLI to import a Haiku into an existing codebase, or you can use the CLI to directly clone a Haiku project to your computer, to access and edit the code manually.

To install, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

`npm install -g @haiku/cli `
OR
`yarn global add @haiku/cli`
