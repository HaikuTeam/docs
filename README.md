# Welcome to Haiku!

These docs are your one-stop shop for everything you need to know about [Haiku](https://haiku.ai).

## I'm new here

Cruise over to [What is Haiku?](what-is-haiku.md) for a brief overview that explains...

* What Haiku is
* Who Haiku is for
* Why you and your team might use Haiku

Or jump right in and checkout [our beginners tutorial](/tutorials/tutorial-1/tutorial.md).

## I'm ready to get started

If you're already hip to what Haiku is all about — and if you're ready to start creating something cool — head over to [our Getting Started guide](getting-started.md), which covers how to:

* Get an invite
* Download and install the app
* Create your first Haiku

## I'm ready for more

Here are some good places to explore Haiku in more detail:

* [Starting a Haiku Project](using-haiku/starting-haiku.md)
* [Creating Animations with the Timeline](using-haiku/creating-an-animation.md)
* [Publishing and Embedding Your Haiku](embedding-and-using-haiku/publishing-and-embedding.md)

## I'm not sure / None of the above

If you're confused about something or don't see the information you're looking for, we recommend reading the [FAQ's](faqs.md) first.

If you want to reach out to us, the best way to do that is on [our community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/haiku-community/shared_invite/enQtMjU0NzExMzQzMjIxLTA3NjgzZDYzYmNjYzcxNmUwY2NhMTE0YTE2OGVjZGE0MDhmNGIxOWUzOTk5OTI5MmQ0ZjA5MDAwNGY1Yjk1OTg) or [by email](mailto:contact@haiku.ai).
