# Haiku Docs: Getting Started

#### GETTING AN INVITE

You can sign up for an invite at [https://www.haiku.ai/](https://www.haiku.ai/) — or you can request an invite from someone who's already using Haiku.

<br>

#### DOWNLOADING HAIKU

When you accept your invite, you will automatically be taken to the download site for Haiku.  If you need to download Haiku again, you can use the same invite link \(note that you will only be able to create a single account.\)

Please install Haiku by dragging it to your /Applications folder.

<br>

#### DOWNLOADING SKETCH

To get the most out of Haiku, you will need Sketch installed (Haiku doesn't have any of its own drawing tools, and we support rich integration with Sketch for this purpose.)

If you don't have Sketch, you can download a free 30-day trial at [https://sketchapp.com/](https://sketchapp.com/)

> _Coming soon:_ We plan to support other drawing tools like Photoshop and Illustrator, plus eventually we'll have some of our own.

#### INSTALLING THE HAIKU CLI

The CLI \(Command Line Interface\) is an optional part of Haiku, but it opens up a lot of powerful features—for example, you need the CLI to import a Haiku into an existing codebase, or you can use the CLI to directly clone a Haiku project to your computer, to access and edit the code manually.

To install, run the following command in your terminal:

`curl http://code.haiku.ai/scripts/cli/installer.js | node`

> Coming soon:  you will soon be able to install the CLI directly from npm, with `npm install -g @haiku/cli`\)
