# Getting Started



#### GETTING AN INVITE

You can sign up for an invite at [https://www.haiku.ai/](https://www.haiku.ai/) — or you can request an invite from someone who's already using Haiku.



#### DOWNLOADING HAIKU

When you accept your invite, you will automatically be taken to the download site for Haiku.  If you need to download Haiku again, you can use the same invite link \(note that you will only be able to create a single account.\)



#### INSTALLING THE HAIKU CLI

The CLI \(Command Line Interface\) is an optional part of Haiku, but it opens up a lot of powerful features—for example, you need the CLI to import a Haiku into a code base, or you can use the CLI to directly clone a Haiku project to your computer, to access and edit the code manually.  See

> Coming soon:  you will soon be able to install the CLI directly from npm, with `npm install -g @haiku/cli`\)
