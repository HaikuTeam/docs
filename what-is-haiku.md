# What is Haiku?

[Haiku](https://haiku.ai) is a desktop app for Mac for creating interactive, animated UI components.

<br>

This is what it looks like when you start a fresh project:

And this is what it might look like after you've created your Haiku:

<br>

With the Haiku app installed on your workstation, you can:

* Bring any Sketch design to life with animation
* Add interactivity by responding to user events and data
* Publish your creation as a clean, web-ready component
* Embed your component with just a few lines of code

<br>

But Haiku is also a lot more than a design tool.

<br>

**Haiku is for shipping to production:** Every component you make in Haiku is automatically optimized for production â€” this is not a prototyping tool. We're building Haiku because we believe creative teams should spend less time making throwaway prototypes, and more time shipping.

<br>

**Haiku is for engineers, too:** Under the hood, every Haiku component is clean JavaScript code that you can always hand-edit, without breaking the link to the source design. No more reworking your handcrafted code as fresh design changes come in. And we provide a [powerful API](embedding-and-using-haiku/haiku-player-api.md) for wiring up your component to external business logic.

<br>

**Haiku is for teams:** Every change you make in Haiku is automatically tracked in a version control system, so your work is always safe. We've taken care to make sure Haiku can integrate with a wide variety of app platforms and frameworks, so your team can try a small sample of Haiku within an existing project to see whether it's right for you. And coming soon, you can expect to see features like real-time collaborative editing, branching, sharing drafts, in-context commenting, and more.
