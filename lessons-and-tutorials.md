# Lessons & Tutorials

We collect resources for learning how to use Haiku on our website on our [learn page](https://www.haiku.ai/learn/), including video tutorials and blog posts.

We always have more tutorial content planned, but if there's a topic you'd like to see us cover more in depth, let us know on [our community Slack](https://www.haiku.ai/slack-community) or [by email](mailto:contact@haiku.ai).
