# Haiku Player

<br>

#### OVERVIEW

The Haiku Player is **NOT** a browser plugin.  It's simply a bundle of JavaScript that is included with your Haikus, that allows them to render on the web using the web's native technologies (HTML, CSS, JS.)

The means Haiku runs anywhere your code does, on any modern browser.

In the simplest case, you don't even have to think about the "player" — we do the heavy lifting and provide the code snippets to include your Haikus in codebases of different kinds (see [Publishing and Embedding](embedding-and-using-haiku/publishing-and-embedding.md).)  One line of code and done.

But sometimes you want more control—maybe you want to control the timeline, or change the sizing mode, or any number of [other programmatic actions](embedding-and-using-haiku/haiku-player-api.md).  For these cases, you can use the Haiku Player Developer API.
