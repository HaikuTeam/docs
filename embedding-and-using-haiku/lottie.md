# iOS & Android Rendering powered by Lottie

#### OVERVIEW

Lottie is an [open source](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) iOS, Android, and React Native library [from Airbnb](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) that renders animations, allowing apps to use animations as easily as they use static images. With Haiku, you can author Lottie compatible animations.
