# Reusable Components

You can create components within the same project using sub-components.


We have a short video tutorial available on Reusable Components that you can watch by clicking below:

#### CREATING A COMPONENT

To create a subcomponent simply highlight your desired component in Haiku and right click on it to "Create Component".

Once you've created your component you will see it available as an editable and reusable component in a new tab on top of your Stage and in the menu under Components.

To use your components, simply drag them onto the Stage from the left hand menu the same way you would with an imported element.
