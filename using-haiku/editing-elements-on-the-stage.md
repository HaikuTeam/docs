# Editing Elements on the Stage

#### ADDING ELEMENTS TO THE STAGE

To get an item from the Library to the Stage, simply drag and drop from the Library.  The new element will show up on the stage where you drop it, and a new row will show up in the Timeline representing the new element.  To learn more about getting elements into the Library, see [Sketch and Image Assets](using-haiku/sketch-and-image-assets.md).

#### SELECTING, RESIZING, ROTATING, DELETING

To select an element on stage, simply click it.

To *Resize,* click and drag one of the control points around the selected object.  Optionally, hold `SHIFT` to maintain aspect ratio and/or hold `ALT` to transform from the object's center.

To *Rotate,* hold `CMD` and hover outside any control point (similar behavior to Sketch.)  Optionally, hold `SHIFT` to lock rotation to increments of 15 degrees.

To *Delete,* once an element is selected, press `DELETE`.

#### ZOOMING AND PANNING

For precise control over elements on the stage, you can zoom and pan.

To *Zoom*, hover over the stage with your mouse and press `CMD + Plus` (zoom in) or `CMD + Minus` (zoom out)

To *Pan*, hover over the stage with your mouse, hold the `Space Bar` and click and drag with the mouse.

#### RESIZING THE STAGE

You can resize the stage (and thus default size for your Haiku component) in two ways:

Visually, you can hover over the stage name until the stage is outlined in pink — then click and you will get a visual resizing tool.

Numerically, you can edit the Size X and Size Y of the top-most element in the timeline.  This has the same effect as changing the size visually.

#### CHANGING STACKING ORDER (Z-INDEX)

To change the stacking order of an element on stage, right-click on it (or `CTRL` + click) and select Send Forward/Backward/To Front/To Back.

<br>

#### UNDO/REDO

To undo/redo changes, press `CMD + Z` (undo) or `CMD + SHIFT + Z` (redo.)  Alternatively, click the Undo/Redo buttons on the toolbar.
