# Just-in-time Properties

Use Just-in-time Properties to dynamically manipulate a wide array of properties throughout your Haiku projects.

Add Just-in-time Properties by clicking the `(+)` button underneath the element name in the timeline. Once a Just-in-time Property has been added, you can manipulate it's value as you would any other property in [the timeline](/using-haiku/creating-an-animation.md).

Just-in-time Properties only accept strings, so be sure to wrap your input in single quotes `''`.
