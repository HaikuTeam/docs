# Importing Figma Projects

Haiku integrates with Figma using their new Web API. Moving forward, we expect the integration to become more rich, polished and capable.

Similar to [Sketch file support](/using-haiku/sketch-and-image-assets.md), it's best to think of using Figma and Haiku together as: **draw in your Figma, bring to life in Haiku.**

Let's first cover how to import your Figma projects into Haiku:

<br>

#### AUTH & ALLOW PERMISSIONS

In the library in Haiku, double click the Figma asset, taking you to your Figma dashboard in your browser.

If you're not logged in to Figma already, you'll be prompted to do so. Once logged in, you'll be asked to give Haiku permission to access your projects.

<br>

#### ADDING A FIGMA PROJECT TO YOUR LIBRARY

Now that Haiku has permission to access your Figma projects, in the library simply enter the Project URL of the project you'd like to work with:

If you're not logged in to Figma already, you'll be prompted to do so. Once logged in, you'll be asked to give Haiku permission to access your projects.

#### WORKING WITH SLICES & GROUPS

Similar to [Sketch file support](/using-haiku/sketch-and-image-assets.md), Haiku imports slices, frames & groups from Figma. The easiest way to import assets from Figma to Haiku is to simply create a group. Alternatively, you can use the slice tool to draw around elements you want to work with:

#### DRAGGING AND DROPPING ITEMS ON STAGE

This one's self-explanatory:  to get an item from the Library to the Stage, simply drag and drop.  The new element will show up on the stage where you drop it, and a new row will show up in the Timeline representing the new element.

<br>

#### RE-SYNCING CHANGES

Haiku never breaks it's connection to your Figma source project. At any time, you can press the "REFRESH" button in your Haiku library to pull the latest changes from your Figma project.
