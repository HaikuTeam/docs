#### HOW TO LINK A SKETCH FILE

Simply click "IMPORT" at the top of the library.

> **Where are the drawing tools?**
> You may notice that there are no drawing tools in Haiku.  Though we may start to add some in the future, this was an intentional decision.  Designers told us resoundingly that they don't want _yet another drawing tool_, so we simply integrated with existing ones.  Think of it this way:  **draw in Sketch, bring to life in Haiku.**

#### CHANGING ASSETS FROM SKETCH

When you import a Sketch file, we automatically make a copy of that file and start tracking changes behind the scenes with Git.  What this means is if you make changes to your original file, they won't show up by default in Haiku.

**To make changes to your Sketch-linked assets, double-click the Sketch file in the library.**  Sketch will launch, and when you **Save** in Sketch, changes will automatically be tracked in Haiku.  Even elements already on the stage remain linked and can be updated directly from Sketch.

#### DRAGGING AND DROPPING ITEMS ON STAGE

This one's self-explanatory:  to get an item from the Library to the Stage, simply drag and drop.  The new element will show up on the stage where you drop it, and a new row will show up in the Timeline representing the new element.
