# Using the Haiku CLI

#### OVERVIEW

The Haiku CLI is the "Swiss army knife" for developers using Haiku.  You can use it to import a Haiku into an existing codebase (essentially `npm install`,) or you can use the CLI to directly clone a Haiku project to your computer, to access and edit the code manually (essentially, `git clone`.)


#### INSTALLATION

To install, run the following command in your terminal:

**With npm:** (and instructions to [install npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) itself)

`npm install -g @haiku/cli`

**With yarn:** (and instructions to [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) itself)

`yarn global add @haiku/cli`
