Name your project on the create project screen, shown below. Note that project names can only contain letters and numbersâ€”no other characters, not even spaces, hyphens, or underscores.

#### PUBLIC & PRIVATE PROJECTS {#publicandprivate}

**Public Projects** are published to public pages that can be discovered on [Haiku Community](https://share.haiku.ai) and from your profile. They are also able to be [forked](../embedding-and-using-haiku/publishing-and-embedding.md#forking) by other users.<br>

**Private Projects** are published to private pages with obfuscated URL's that are extremely difficult to guess, making them a secure way to publish projects you wish to keep private from the wider web.

<br>

#### SHARING A PROJECT WITH TEAMMATES {#share}

Every project is shared with all of your teammates by default! Simply press "Publish" to share your changes. [Read more about Publishing.](../embedding-and-using-haiku/publishing-and-embedding.md) New changes your teammates have made will be brought in every time you open a project or Publish.
