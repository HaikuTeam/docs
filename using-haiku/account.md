#### Logging In

When you first open Haiku, you will be prompted to log in.  Enter the username and password you created when you accepted your invite.  If you forgot, you can contact [Haiku support](mailto:support@haiku.ai) for help.

**Haiku CLI option:**  you can run `haiku login` to log in interactively from the command line.  You can also run `haiku logout` to log out.

Note that new projects can only contain letters and numbersâ€”no other characters, not even spaces, hyphens, or underscores.

Also note:  currently there's a limit of 15 projects per account.  Please contact [Haiku support](mailto:support@haiku.ai) if you need to raise this limit.

#### Sharing a Project with Teammates

Every project is shared with all of your teammates by default!  Simply press "Publish" to share your changes.  [Read more about Publishing.](embedding-and-using-haiku/publishing-and-embedding.md)  New changes your teammates have made will be brought in every time you open a project or Publish.

> Coming soon:  we plan to add support for realtime collaborative editing in the near future.  In the meantime, you must "Publish" to synchronize changes with teammates.
