# Actions

Use Actions to execute small snippets of JavaScript throughout your project. Actions are designed to be accessible to people who only know a little code, or who want to learnâ€”as well as to engineers.

You can use Actions to:

* Travel through time by changing the timeline position
* Respond to user input
* Work with real data
* Change properties of elements
* And more!

If you haven't already, check out [Tutorial 2: Interactivity with Actions](https://medium.com/haiku-blog/designing-the-real-thing-with-haiku-actions-a80ccddfcb1) to see Actions in action.

#### EVENT ACTIONS
